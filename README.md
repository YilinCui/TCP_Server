### TCP Server-Client Interaction and Data Processing Workflow
- Start
- TCP Server Listens on port 8888
- Client Connects -> Server creates new Thread
- Thread Creates Controller.ICDDevice instance
- DecodingPacket class decodes incoming data
- Perform Corresponding I/O operations
- Process data
- Server sends encoded packet back to client
- Repeat (until client disconnects)
- End
